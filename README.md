# Hashing
Hashing, completed in December 2016, was the third assignment of my Programing in C course. The assignment involved investigating different techniques for hashing. A 'spell checker' was the context for the investigation and the program would take in two text files as inputs. The first would be a dictionary of words to store and the second would be a list of words to lookup (spell check) in the dictionary. The program would report the average number of lookups taken to find (or not find) each word that was being checked in the dictionary, thus giving us a way of comparing different the different hashing techniques.

## Assignment
The assignment involved implementing the dictionary using different hashing techniques. The structure of the assignment and this repository is as follows:

#### Double Hashing
Use a double hashing a technique to resolve collisions in the hash table used for the dictionary.

#### Separate Chaining
For the dictionary, use separate chaining to deal with collisions by forming linked lists out from a base array.

#### Extension 
An extension of the program in some way. I chose to compare the effectiveness of different hash functions whilst using the double hashing approach and display the results using SDL.

## Disclaimer
I have have confirmed with the University that I am able to publish my solution to this assignment. However, as there is the possibility that a similar assignment may still be used by the University, I have been informed that I should state that *this work cannot be used without my permission* and if it is submitted by as current student as their own, they will be investigated for plagiarism.
